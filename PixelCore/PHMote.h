 * What's a PixelMote?
 *
 * It's a wireless controller for the Pixel Heart. You can get the code for it here:
 * https://github.com/ThePixelHeart/PixelMote
 *
 * The PixelDriver runs a PHMoteServer in the background that listens for connections
 * from PixelMotes. The messages received from the motes is chomped up and packaged
 * with the PHAnimationDriver that all animations can access via self.driver.
 *
 * See PHSimpleMoteAnimation for an example animation using the mote.
